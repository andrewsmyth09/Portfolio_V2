Why isn't building a strong foundation being discussed enough to generate high-quality leads on LinkedIn?  

My first guess is AI copycat ninjas, but I'll let you be the judge on that one.

I'm chasing partnership leads on LinkedIn for a startup **for the first time**, and I'm on my own.  

I searched the internet for how to get partnership leads to get a head start. After growing frustrated by the same generic advice, I even gave ChatGPT a go.  

Again, same story:  

- Optimize your profile  
- Create engaging content  
- Use LinkedIn search… blah, blah, blah  

It's not that these tips are completely useless—they just don't mention the most obvious **first steps every good marketer should take**.  

That's right, I'm talking about **setting a foundation**.  

Or, in other words: **knowing my ideal partner inside out.**

After all, what good is an "optimized profile" to me if I don't have a clear picture of who I'm trying to partner with?  

I want strong partnership leads, **not any lead**.  
To do that, I'm going to build a foundation first, using these three steps:

## Step 1: Pick Your Ideal Partner Profile (IPP)
Let's start with the most obvious one: identifying your **Ideal Partner Profile (IPP).**

To put it simply, your IPP is the perfect type of company that would want to partner with your business. It's the organization that will most likely say *"yes, let's explore this partnership"* when you come knocking.  

By knowing your IPP, you can pick the type of companies that are the right fit for collaboration, based on things like:  

- Shared audience  
- Complementary services  
- Aligned values  
- Geographic overlap  

So instead of chasing up every potential partner on LinkedIn, make better use of your time by focusing on **relevant partnership opportunities.**

## Step 2: Find Decision-Makers
Step 1? ✅ Check.  

Now it's time to find the people in your IPP companies that you want to talk to—your **target persona.**

Remember:  
- Your **IPP** identifies which companies are the right fit for partnership.  
- Your **target persona** describes the personnel who can say *"yes"* to partnerships inside your IPP.  

It's a little like a **character bio in a video game**: you'll know what they do, what they want, what pains them, and what motivates them.  

### A Quick Example
I got an old spreadsheet of potential partners from the startup I'm working for. It's very detailed: I can see company phone numbers and emails (like `info@companyname.com`).  

Is this helpful for partnerships? **Nope.**  

These are generic contact details. If I reach out here, I'll probably get someone who either:  
- Won’t be interested in partnerships, or  
- Won’t be able to say *"yes"* to them.  

The people who can say *"yes"* to partnerships are the ones that matter.  
I hope to replace any irrelevant contact details with ones that lead me **straight to the decision-makers.**

## Step 3: Research Leads… Like Mad
You’ve got your IPP and target personas nailed down—great. But don’t fall into the trap of leaving it there!  

Knowledge is your **currency** in partnership development.  

The more you understand about your potential partners, the better you can communicate mutual value to them.  

So don't leave it to chance.  

### Why LinkedIn Helps
Fortunately, for B2B lead generation, LinkedIn is a haven. Most decision-makers (managers, directors, CEOs, etc.) have a profile and post on it.  

This is your free pass to see:  
- How they describe themselves  
- The content they create  
- The partnership challenges they share at their companies  

## The Next Part Everybody Recommends
Once these steps are complete, you should have a **solid foundation** to begin gathering high-quality partnership leads on LinkedIn.  

Yep, here's the next part that just about every blog, social media, and AI post recommends:  

- "Optimize" your LinkedIn profile  
- Create content that speaks to your audience, gets their attention, and builds trust  
- Begin building your prospect list  
- Outline how a partnership would be a win-win for you and your prospect  

## A Final Note on Your LinkedIn Profile
One point I would like to stress here: your LinkedIn profile is your **shop window.**

- Make it about your **potential partners**, not you.  
- Write everything from your potential partner's viewpoint as the reader.  
- Show them you understand their challenges and how partnering with you solves them.  

Do the same with the content you post.  

You're not on LinkedIn to tell your career story; you're on it to **attract partnership opportunities.**
